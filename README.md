# WiFi-weather-station-SensorUnit
Wemos D1 esp8266 code written in C for hosting data from weather sensors.

With this code, board connects to configured WiFi AP and hosts data from DHT22 and BMP280 sensors (air temperature, humidity, pressure).

This board was designed to act as a wireless weather station. All readings were parsed by an Android App, which you can find in my [WiFi-weather-station-App](https://github.com/kubala887/WiFi-weather-station-App) repository.
